## Getting Started
### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/djdcybersecurity/Python-for-Health-Sciences-Healthcare.git
cd Python-for-Health-Sciences-Healthcare
```

### Install Dependencies
This course uses Python 3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Code
Most of the exercises are structured as **Jupyter Notebooks**. You can open and run them using:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Or if you're using **Google Colab**, simply upload the `.ipynb` files.

## Why Python for Healthcare?
